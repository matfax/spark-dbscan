#DBSCAN for Spark

[![](https://jitpack.io/v/matfax/spark-dbscan.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#matfax/spark-dbscan)

Spark DBSCAN is an implementation of the [DBSCAN clustering algorithm](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN) on top of [Apache Spark](http://spark.apache.org/) . It also includes 2 simple tools which will help you choose parameters of the DBSCAN algorithm.

This software is **EXPERIMENTAL** , it supports only Euclidean and Manhattan distance measures ( [why?](../../wiki/How-It-Works#why-not-all-distance-measures-are-supported) ) and it is not well optimized yet. I tested it only on small datasets (millions of records with 2 features in each record).

You can use Spark DBSCAN as a standalone application which you can submit to a Spark cluster ( [Learn how](../../wiki/Using-Spark-DBSCAN-as-a-standalone-application) ). Alternatively, you can include it into your own app - its API is [documented](http://alitouka-public.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/spark_dbscan/releases/0.0.2/scaladoc/#org.alitouka.spark.dbscan.package) and easy to use ( [Learn how](../../wiki/Including-Spark-DBSCAN-in-your-application) ).
